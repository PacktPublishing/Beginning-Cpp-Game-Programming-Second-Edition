This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Set up your game development project in Visual Studio 2019 and explore C++ libraries such as SFML
* Explore C++ OOP by building a Pong game
* Understand core game concepts such as game animation, game physics, collision detection, scorekeeping, and game sound
* Use classes, inheritance, and references to spawn and control thousands of enemies and shoot rapid-fire machine guns
* Add advanced features to your game using pointers, references, and the STL
* Scale and reuse your game code by learning modern game programming design patterns
